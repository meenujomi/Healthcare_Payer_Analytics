# Healthcare_Payer_Analytics
## Objective
A care management organisation called WeCare wants to identify among its diabetic patients, the ones that are at high risk of getting re-admitted to the hospital. They wish to intervene by providing some incentive to these patients that will help them improve their health. As the star analyst of this organisation, your job is to identify high-risk diabetic patients through risk stratification. This will help the payer to decide what are the right intervention programs for these patients.
